# nlp-multidocumentsummarization
School project

Natural language processing implemented in Java to do summarization of multiple news articles. We do a coherence based text summarization here based on K-means clustering and weightage based on word semantic relations. Coherence is maintained in the final summary so that its more readable and easily understood.
